Building and Running a Qt Application: MyFileExplorer

Introduction
This document outlines the steps necessary to compile and execute a Qt application named MyFileExplorer. The instructions are tailored for users operating on Linux systems, particularly those using Ubuntu, Fedora, or Arch Linux.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure that you have the following:
A Linux-based operating system (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch Linux, etc.)
   Basic knowledge of terminal commands
   Step 1: Install Qt Development Libraries
   To compile and run Qt applications, you need to install the necessary Qt development libraries. Execute the following commands based on your Linux distribution:
   For Ubuntu/Debian:
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install qt5-default qttools5-dev-tools libqt5widgets5 libqt5gui5 libqt5core5a

   For Fedora:
   sudo dnf install qt5-qtbase-devel qt5-qtsvg-devel qt5-qttools-devel

   For Arch Linux:
   sudo pacman -S qt5-base qt5-tools

   Step 2: Verify Required Tools
   Ensure that the necessary Qt tools, such as qmake and moc, are installed and accessible in your terminal. You can check for qmake by running:
   qmake --version

   Step 3: Handling Warnings and Errors
   Warning: Failed to Resolve Include

   If you encounter warnings regarding unresolved include files, specifically moc_predefs.h, it may indicate that the moc (Meta-Object Compiler) cannot locate required header files.

   To resolve this issue:
   Clean the previous build artifacts:
   make clean

   Rebuild the project:
   make

   Step 4: Verify Your Makefile
   Ensure that your Makefile is correctly configured. A basic example of a Makefile for MyFileExplorer is shown below:

   Step 5: Run Your Application
   Once the application is compiled without errors, you can run it by executing:
   ./MyFileExplorer

   Conclusion
   By following these steps, you should be able to successfully compile and execute your Qt application, MyFileExplorer. If you encounter specific errors during compilation, please review the error messages for troubleshooting or seek additional assistance.
